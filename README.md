# progress-bar-application
This is a quick and fun "visual progress bar application". Each step that is taken/clicked is noted on the "next" button. Each step can be reversed with the "prev/previous" button. The reset button will work to reset the progress whenever needed. Once the progress has reached the length(4) the "next" button can no longer be activated until the user clicks either the "prev/previous" button or "reset". This was a fun project to test my understanding of Event Listeners and if/else if statements.
